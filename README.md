# BookingAPI
A little exercise about API's

WARNING
=======
The following exercise it's just a personal experiment that I would like to keep private, but, you know, **this humble princess can't affort 5 aussie golden coins a month**, so this is my *__disclaimer of liability__*:
The humble code that you find in this repo may not help anybody with anything in particular, it may not be my own code, so it may contain somebody elses code and as you may guess, It may have really horrible mistakes, typos and bad programming practices.
